What is Gnatsweb?
=================

    Gnatsweb is a web front-end to GNATS, the GNU Problem Report
    Management System.  It is a PERL CGI script which runs on your web
    server.


How does Gnatsweb differ from...
================================

    * wwwgnats?  Gnatsweb was inspired by wwwgnats.  Gnatsweb uses
      gnatsd, so your web server and GNATS server don't have to be on
      the same machine or have access to your network.  Gnatsweb has
      better queries, and you can store them.

    * CERN-wwwgnats?  Gnatsweb does not reqiure any patches to GNATS.
      Gnatsweb is simple to install.

    * juniper-web-reports?  I don't really know.  Gnatsweb talks to
      gnatsd directly, it doesn't use nquery-pr.


System Requirements
===================

    Gnatsweb requires that you have the following:

    * The 'gnatsd' network daemon installed and configured, version
      3.108 or greater.  This version will not work with GNATS
      versions 4 and higher

    * Write access to a CGI-enabled directory on your web server.

    * Perl 5, with the fine CGI.pm module.
      There has been trouble reported with a version of perl
      prior to 5.004_04.


Where do I get it?
==================

    ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/gnatsweb/

    It's also available in the contrib/gnatsweb directory of the GNATS
    distribution, but since GNATS and Gnatsweb releases aren't
    synchronized, this version will often be outdated.

    Note that versions of Gnatsweb numbered 2.x only work with 3.x
    versions of GNATS.


How do I install it?
====================

    Read the INSTALL file.


Who wrote it?
=============

    Gnatsweb was originally written by Matt Gerassimoff and Kenneth H.
    Cox.  It is currently being maintained by Yngve Svendsen.

    Thanks to all the people who contributed patches.

    Grateful acknowledgement is given to the authors of wwwgnats, a
    precursor to Gnatsweb in spirit if not in code base:
    Dan Kegel and Huy Le, Brian Behlendorf and Ken Coar.
