What is Gnatsweb?
=================

    Gnatsweb is a web interface to GNATS, the GNU Problem Report
    Management System.  It is a Perl CGI script which runs on your web
    server.


System Requirements
===================

    Gnatsweb 4 requires that you have the following:

    * The 'gnatsd' network daemon installed and configured, version
      4.0 beta 2 or greater.

      IMPORTANT: Gnatsweb 4.x will NOT work with GNATS 3.x

    * Write access to a CGI-enabled directory on your web server.

    * Perl 5, with the fine CGI.pm module, version 2.56 or newer.
      Note that the unofficial 3.x versions of CGI.pm have been
      reported not to work. There has been trouble reported with a
      version of perl prior to 5.004_04.


Where do I get it?
==================

    ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/gnatsweb/

    It's also available in the contrib/gnatsweb directory of the GNATS
    distribution, but since GNATS and Gnatsweb releases aren't
    necessarily synchronized, this version will often be outdated.

    Note that versions of Gnatsweb numbered 4.x only work with 4.x
    versions of GNATS.

How do I install it?
====================

    Read the INSTALL file.  For postinstall customization, read
    CUSTOMIZE, then CUSTOMIZE.vars and CUSTOMIZE.cb.


Who wrote it?
=============

    Gnatsweb was originally written by Matt Gerassimoff and Kenneth
    H. Cox.  It is currently being maintained by Yngve Svendsen.  Dirk
    Bergstrom made very significant contributions.

    Grateful acknowledgement is given to the authors of wwwgnats, a
    precursor to gnatsweb in spirit if not in code base: Dan Kegel and
    Huy Le, Brian Behlendorf and Ken Coar.
