==========  gnatsweb 2.8.2 released ====================================

2001-06-26  Yngve Svendsen  <yngve.svendsen@clustra.com>

	* gnatsweb.pl (help_page): Fix a serious security hole where an
	attacker would be able to read any file on the system or run any
	command to which the web server process user had access to by
	submitting a rogue help_file parameter in the URL. help_file is
	now hardcoded to 'gnatsweb.html'.

==========  gnatsweb 2.8.1 released ====================================
	
2001-06-04  Yngve Svendsen  <yngve.svendsen@clustra.com>

	* Remove the last vestige of sourceware.cygnus.com from the help
	  URL and change version number to 2.8.1

	* INSTALL: Clarified item 5, it should now be abundantly clear
	  that you need a gnats-db.conf file even if you have only a
	  single database.

	* gnatsweb.pl (parse_categories): No longer exclude 'pending' from
	  the category search list. This restriction made little sense.

	* gnatsweb.pl: use CGI.pm with oldstyle URLs. Otherwise,
	  redirection back to the query page after submitting edits won't
	  work.

	* gnatsweb.pl (one_line_submit): Gnatsweb 2.8.0 actually required
	  JavaScript for the main menu to work. This had been added to
	  Gnatsweb 2.7 beta in order to preserve vertical space. Requiring
	  JavaScript is unacceptable for many sites, so we revert to the
	  old style.

==========  gnatsweb 2.8.0 released ====================================

2001-05-02  Yngve Svendsen  <yngve.svendsen@clustra.com>

	* gnatsweb.pl (view): Use error_page to output errors.

	* gnatsweb.pl (view, edit): Display PR number in page title.

	* gnatsweb.pl (mark_urls): Added a couple of characters to the
	  regexp in order to properly mark groups.google.com's somewhat
	  bizarre URLs.

==========  gnatsweb 2.8.0 beta (nonpublic) ============================

2001-05-02  Yngve Svendsen  <yngve.svendsen@clustra.com>

	* gnatsweb.pl: Version number changed to 2.8.0.

        * gnatsweb.pl: (main_page): Display the Gnats version number in
          the footer, together with the Gnatsweb version number.

	* gnatsweb (submitedit): Move the output of the 'Edit successful'
	  message so that it now happens after the unlocking of the PR.
	  This solves a problem where a lock file would be left over if
	  the user pressed the browser's 'stop' button during a submit.

2001-05-01  Yngve Svendsen  <yngve.svendsen@clustra.com>

	* gnatsweb.pl (submitedit): Handle errors from lockpr. Previously,
	  even if lockpr returned an error (together with undef in place
	  of the complete PR), Gnatsweb would go on attempting to submit
	  edits based on this blank PR, stopping only when the
	  Last-Modified dates were being compared.

	* README: Updated somewhat.
	  INSTALL: Updated and significantly expanded item 5 about 'make
	  test', explicitly mentioning /etc/gnats-db.conf in connection
	  with the db_alias parameter passed to make test. Added 2 known
	  problems at the bottom of the file.
	  NEWS: New file, with a summary of the changes from 2.7 beta to
	  2.8.0.

	* gnatsweb.pl (display_query_results, page_heading) Fix a couple
	  of variable declarations that were generating perl -w warnings.
	  Do a semi-ugly HTML hack where nowrap, which is supposed to be
	  a boolean attribute, is replaced with nowrap=>'1'. Plain
	  'nowrap' generates a perl -w warning from CGI.pm.

	* gnatsweb.pl (query_page, display_query_results, sendpr,
	  print_attachments, edit, login_page): Systematic cleaning of
	  HTML. Tons of table tags terminated.

	* gnatsweb.pl (advanced_query_page): Add a line below 'Closed
	  After' and 'Closed Before' reminding users to uncheck 'Ignore
	  Closed'. Lots of HTML fixes. Added a little bit of vertical space
	  between tables.

2001-04-30  Yngve Svendsen  <yngve.svendsen@clustra.com>

	* gnatsweb.pl (error_page, submitedit): Enclose $err_text in
	  paragraph tags.

	* gnatsweb.pl (view, edit): Add a check for non-digit characters
	  in PR numbers. If such characters are found, an appropriate
	  error message is issued. gnatsd will actually accept PR numbers
	  on the format string/xxxx, where xxxx is a number, and return
	  the appropriate PR. However, when edits are submitted to such a PR,
	  a new PR with the "number" 'string/xxxx' would be created, with
	  the same category as the original PR. This is a workaround for
	  that problem.

	* gnatsweb.pl: Add some missing paragraph tags in order to make
	  stylesheet formatting work properly.

	* gnatsweb.pl: (page_heading): Set the width of the table
	  containing the page heading and database, username and access
	  level to 100%. Opera would display a too narrow table when the
	  width wasn't explicitly set.

	* gnatsweb.pl: (page_start_html): Make the banner a bit smaller,
	  and use a different typeface. Should work well in all browsers.

	* gnatsweb.pl: (display_query_results): Correct a couple of
	  typos in the escapeHTML calls.

	* gnats.pm (get_reply): gerror() was not being called when server
	  returned $CODE_NO_PRS, as this was not being considered an
	  error. This made Gnatsweb attempt to 'edit' or 'view' PRs with
	  any number typed into the main page edit or view textfields,
	  whether the PR with that number actually existed or not. Editing
	  caused a new PR to be created, with the erroneous number. It
	  basically accepted any input from these textfields, making it
	  possible to create PRs with "numbers" made out of arbitrary
	  strings.
	
	* gnatsweb.pl (readpr): Add an if clause to trigger on errors
	  from the gnats.pm client_cmd subroutine. This fixed the problem
	  mentioned above.

	* gnatsweb.html: Clean up HTML, fix spelling, remove some <I>'s
	  and <B>'s that made the text less readable. Some slight
	  rephrasing in order to clarify things.

	* gnatsweb.pl (main): Add an explicit link to the automatic
	  redirection page. Fix due to Mark Kuchel.

        * gnatsweb.pl (main): Generate proper cookie paths. Fix
          due to Mark Kuchel.

	* gnatsweb.pl (submitedit): Issue an HTTP-EQUIV Refresh META tag in
	  HEAD, in addition to the standard Refresh HTTP header. This
	  makes the post-edit redirect work in MS Internet Explorer.

	* gnatsweb.pl (login_page_javascript): Use correct <SCRIPT
	  LANGUAGE>.

2001-04-29  Yngve Svendsen  <yngve.svendsen@clustra.com>

	* gnatsweb.pl (download_attachment): Insert a conditional to send
	  the header based on HTTP_USER_AGENT. MS Internet Explorer 5.5
	  would attempt to save downloaded attachments under the same name
	  as the Gnatsweb script file, typically gnatsweb.pl. This is
	  because MSIE handles the HTTP header "Content-Disposition:
	  attachment" wrongly. It needs "file" instead of "attachment".

	* gnatsweb.pl (decode_attachment): Editing bugs with attached
          files used to bomb out trying to chomp a constant string. Fix
          due to Tommi Virtanen.
	
	* gnatsweb.pl (mark_urls): New function. 
	  (view): Use it.
	  (edit): Likewise.
	  This is basically Tom Tromey's patch for Gnats 4 Gnatsweb 
	  backported to 2.7beta.

	* gnatsweb.pl: Remove the original authors' e-mail addresses,
	  they are no longer valid.

	* gnatsweb.pl: New configuration variable $site_stylesheet.
	  (page_start_html): Use it.

	* gnatsweb.pl: Bump version number to 2.8.0-dev.

	* gnatsweb.pl: (display_query_results): Apply CGI.pm's escapeHTML
	  to field contents when printing the query results. Allow the
	  Synopsis field to wrap.

==========  gnatsweb 2.7 beta ===================================

2000-01-15  Kenneth H. Cox  <kenstir@abraham.senteinc.com>

	* Bug fix: Gnatsweb will no longer allow you to store a query if
	this would result in more than 20 cookies.  Otherwise random
	cookies get dropped and things start acting weird.  20 is a
	magical number as defined in
	http://home.netscape.com/newsref/std/cookie_spec.html.

	* Enhancement: Added a 'View for bookmarking' link, which reloads
	the same query so that you can bookmark it in your browser.

2000-01-14  Kenneth H. Cox  <kenstir@abraham.senteinc.com>

	* Bug fix: Modifying the CC list (X-GNATS-Notify header) was not
	working if X-GNATS-Notify existed but was empty.

2000-01-13  Kenneth H. Cox  <kenstir@abraham.senteinc.com>

	* Enhancement: Main page has been shrunk vertically so that all
	buttons fit on one page.

2000-01-12  Kenneth H. Cox  <kenstir@abraham.senteinc.com>

	* Enhancement: If there's a query name, show it on the Query
	Results page.

2000-01-11  Kenneth H. Cox  <kenstir@abraham.senteinc.com>

	* Enhancement: Allow sorting of query results by Arrival-Date,
	Last-Modified, and Closed-Date.

2000-01-09  Kenneth H. Cox  <kenstir@abraham.senteinc.com>

	* Usability enhancement: If a PR edit succeeds, you are returned
	(refreshed) to the page you were looking at before you edited the
	PR.  It behaves similarly for viewing a PR.  So, if you query,
	then view, then edit, after submitting the edit you will see
	"edit succeeded" briefly, then your query will be reexecuted.

	* Experiment: Use CGI::Pretty instead of CGI so that output HTML
	is more readable.  As if you care.  Nah..that screws up the
	user/access/date heading.

	* Experiment: Use <table cols=N> to see whether cols= speeds up
	large table displays.  The cols= is a Netscape extension.
	Nah...didn't make any difference.

	* New feature: Now the site_callback can 
	- add buttons to the bottom of the main page
	  (args: 'main_page_bottom_buttons)
	- handle new commands (param 'cmd') added by those buttons
	  (args: 'cmd', $cmd)

2000-01-08  Kenneth H. Cox  <kenstir@abraham.senteinc.com>

	* Bug fix: If you don't have MIME::Base64 and you don't want to
	use file attachments, you should no longer get the annoying errors
	in the error_log.

	* New feature: The more comprehensive help text that Matt wrote is
	now available via the Help button.

	* New feature: New module chart.pm thanks to the generous
	contributions of Mike Sutton <suttonm@saic.com>.
	
2000-01-05  Kenneth H. Cox  <kenstir@abraham.senteinc.com>

	* Reorganization: The code which talks to gnatsd is separated out
	into a new module called gnats.pm.  This module will make it
	easier for people to write small scripts to perform
	special-purpose queries.  I intend to use it to implement a few
	graphs.

1999-12-24  Kenneth H. Cox  <kenstir@abraham.senteinc.com>

	* New feature: If you enable setting the Responsible person on the
	Create Problem Report page (by turning off the $SENDEXCLUDE flag),
	then the default value of Responsible is '<default>' which gets
	removed when the PR is sent.

1999-12-18  Kenneth H. Cox  <kenstir@abraham.senteinc.com>

	* Bug fix: Don't use 'diff -u' during 'make test'; not everyone
	has gnu diff.

	* New features: Now the site_callback can
	- filter the available list of databases
	  (args: 'list_databases')
	- supply the list of valid values for an enum field
	  (args: 'edit_pr', category, fieldname)
	- provide a site-specific PR sort routine
	  (args: 'sort_query', 'custom', 'checking_if_custom_sort_exists')
	  (args: 'sort_query', sort_name, @pr_array)
	Patch by Robert Lupton the Good <rhl@astro.princeton.edu>.

	* New feature: Query results now prints the date at the top of the
	page.
	Patch by Robert Lupton the Good <rhl@astro.princeton.edu>.

1999-12-03  Kenneth H. Cox  <kenstir@abraham.senteinc.com>

	* Bug fix: $GNATS_ADDR should not have been copied on email sent
	after an edit.  Now $GNATS_ADDR is only copied on email sent using
	the "send email" link.

==========  gnatsweb 2.6 released ===================================

1999-11-30  Kenneth H. Cox  <kenstir@abraham.senteinc.com>

	* Enhancement: If user does not have cookies enabled, they now get
	a warning on the Login page.  Previously, you would have to submit
	the login page before you got the warning, then you would have to
	go back and resubmit the page.  A little JavaScript goes a long
	way.

1999-11-27  Kenneth H. Cox  <kenstir@abraham.senteinc.com>

	* Enhancement: If DEFAULT_RELEASE is set in the gnats config file,
	then it is now used as the default value in new PR's.
	Patch by Brian Cameron <Brian.Cameron@Eng.Sun.COM>.

	* Bug fix: In "send email" link, include GNATS_ADDR.
	Patch by Jason Molenda <jsm@cygnus.com>.

	* Enhancement: Reversed the default sort, so that new PR's appear
	before older ones.  Added some more debug prints.
	Patch by Tim Riker <TimR@CalderaSystems.com>.

1999-11-18  Kenneth H. Cox  <kenstir@abraham.senteinc.com>

	* New features: Now the site_callback can
	- supply default values for various things until they are
	specified and stored in the user's cookies: Reporter's
	email...(more coming?).  This facilitates that first PR for new
	people.
	- print new buttons at top+bottome of main page.
	- print stuff at the top of individual fields on the sendpr and
	editpr pages.

	See gnatsweb-site-sente.pl for	examples.

	* Bug fix: The default list of columns displayed for a query was
	empty; now it isn't.  You can still get the empty list if you
	explicitly turn off all columns.

==========  gnatsweb 2.6 beta2 released ===================================

1999-11-17  Kenneth H. Cox  <kenstir@abraham.senteinc.com>

	* New feature: Now all links and forms contain the database param,
	so that you can keep multiple databases open in multiple browser
	windows.

==========  gnatsweb 2.6 beta released ===================================

1999-11-14  Kenneth H. Cox  <kenstir@abraham.senteinc.com>

	* New feature? Cookies are now stored with path=/.  I don't know
	if this'll help IE users or not; I actually did it to share
	cookies between my test web and my main web.  You should still be
	able to get to your stored queries, and even delete them.

	* New feature: If you follow a URL such as
	http://www.x.com/cgi-bin/gnatsweb.pl?cmd=view&database=main&pr=1269
	and you are forced to login, then after logging in you will be
	redirected to the requested age.  I tried doing this with a
	redirect but that didn't work; had to use a somewhat ugly
	zero-delay refresh.  If you can figure that out I'd be grateful.

	* New feature: Split cookies into a global cookie (column
	preference and email addr) and a db-specific cookie.  That way you
	don't have to keep typing in different passwords if you change
	db's.

	* Code reorg: Cleaned up the main proc especially w.r.t. the
	cookie-setting stuff.  Now all of the preference settings happen
	at once, and there is only one 'switch' over all of the commands.
	However, if you don't have cookies enabled I probably broke the
	detection of this error.

1999-11-13  Kenneth H. Cox  <kenstir@abraham.senteinc.com>

	* New feature: Added a button to delete stored queries.
	Patch by Robert Lupton the Good <rhl@astro.princeton.edu>.

	* Bug fix (get_mailto_link): MSIE users need special handling in
	the mailto: link.
	Patch by <ralph_pursifull@am.exch.hp.com>.

==========  gnatsweb 2.5 released ===================================

1999-10-16  Kenneth H. Cox  <kenstir@abraham.senteinc.com>

	* Bug fix: Attachment file names are now stripped of any path
	elements, so that the browser doesn't prompt you to save,
	e.g. c:\windows\system.ini

	* New feature: In the Query Results page, there is now an edit
	link next to the view link, if you have edit priviledges.

1999-10-13  Kenneth H. Cox  <kenstir@abraham.senteinc.com>

	* New feature: If you have an "unknown" category, then gnatsweb
	will use it as the default, and issue an error if somebody tries
	to submit a PR with Category=unknown.
	Patch by Robert Lupton the Good <rhl@astro.princeton.edu>.

1999-10-01  Kenneth H. Cox  <kenstir@abraham.senteinc.com>

	* Bug fix: When parsing a PR with a description field containing
	From:, gnatsweb would erroneously save that as the originator's
	email address.
	Patch by Elgin Lee <ehl@terisa.com>.

1999-09-28  Kenneth H. Cox  <kenstir@abraham.senteinc.com>

	* Bug fix: For release-based gnats, "target" should have been
	"quarter".

1999-09-24  Ken Cox  <kenstir@special-sauce.senteinc.com>

	* Bug fix (main): Gnatsweb was not handling failed logins
	correctly.  Thanks to Robert Abatecola <robert@tsgus.com>
	for the fix.

==========  gnatsweb 2.5 beta2 ======================================

1999-09-23  Kenneth H. Cox  <kenstir@abraham.senteinc.com>

	* Bug fix: An extra blank attachment was getting added during
	edit.  Now it isn't.

	* New feature: Can now delete file attachments.

	* Enhancement: gnatsweb-site.pl can now set $site_post_max.
	If this is set, and a post exceeds this limit, then gnatsweb will
	fail with an error.  This prevents somebody from swamping your
	server by attaching a huge file.

	* Enhancement: Now sets cookie only when the cookie values
	change.  This makes it much less annoying for people who have
	cookie prompting turned on.
	Patch by Ronald J. Kimball <rkimball@vgi.com> and
	Robert Abatecola <robert@tsgus.com>.

1999-09-20  Kenneth H. Cox  <kenstir@abraham.senteinc.com>

	* New feature: gnatsweb-site.pl can now override basic color
	selections without using the complicated site_callback method.  I
	do this so that I can tell visually when I'm running a test
	version of gnatsweb and when I'm running the production version.
	See $site_background, $site_banner_foreground,
	$site_banner_background.

==========  gnatsweb 2.5 beta ======================================

1999-09-19

	* New feature: Experimental support for file
	attachments in the Unformatted field.  Use MIME::Base64 package
	because it makes life easy.  Looked at but did not use MIME-tools
	for creating and parsing the attachments, because it required that
	too many packages be installed (it contains 21 packages and it
	requires 5 more).  For this to work you need CGI.pm-2.56 and
	any version of MIME::Base64.

	This I consider this support experimental because
            - it's tested, but not all that thoroughly
            - it requires you to get new perl packages
              CGI.pm-2.56
              MIME::Base64
            - there is as yet no way to delete file attachments
            - uploading a big file can cause the appearance that gnatsweb
	      is hung.  I think a workaround is to set $CGI::POST_MAX
	      but I haven't tried it.

	* Enhancement: Added 'send email' link to edit page.  Used to be
	present only on view page.

	* Enhancement: Added submit + reset buttons to top of
	Create PR form.

	* Enhancement (test.pl): Die if loading gnatsweb.pl or
	gnatsweb-site has errors.
	Patch from Ronald J. Kimball <rkimball@vgi.com>

	* Enhancement (validate_email_field): Used regexp donated by
	rkimball@vgi.com to allow @ in email addresses only if it's
	followed by what looks more or less like a domain name.

	* Bug fix (submit_stored_query): Must use full (not relative) URL
	in redirect, to work around bug interacting with Netscape
	Enterprise Server 3.5.1.
	Patch from Elgin Lee <ehl@terisa.com>.

	* Bug fix (initialize): Keyword query should have been 'kywd' not
	'keyw'.
	Patch from Elgin Lee <ehl@terisa.com>.

	* Bug fix (sendpr): Removed "CC" capability, as it was causing too
	much confusion.  That field would only send a copy of the initial
	PR, but wouldn't put you on the X-Gnats-Notify list; everyone here
	thought it would. Now there are only "Reporter's email" and "CC
	these people on PR status email".  Also, the latter list gets a
	copy of the initial PR.  Hopefully that will clear up the
	confusion.

	* Bug fix (sendpr): The X-Gnats-Notify field was not handling
	lists of email addresses properly.  Now it is.
	Patch from James Lin <james@jeditech.com>.

	* Bug fix (submitedit): Really fixed the following bug:
	When sending mail, use email address in
	responsible file as From, if present.
	Reported by Jason Molenda <jsm@cygnus.com>.
	Thanks, Carl Lindberg for pointing this out.

==========  gnatsweb 2.4 released ======================================

1999-07-27  Kenneth H. Cox  <kenstir@abraham.senteinc.com>

	* Enhancement?:  Added HTML help (gnatsweb.html) provided by Matt.
	As yet, there is no way to get to this help file from within
	gnatsweb.  A patch to do this would be appreciated.  Note that to
	keep installation drop-dead simple, this HTML help should be
	served up by gnatsweb itself, not installed in a separate file
	(which for an Apache server would need to be installed into a
	separate directory).

	* Requested enhancement: Use version number (not revision number)
	on main page.

	* Bug fix (get_reply): Gnatsweb was mangling some gnatsd error
	messages so as to make them ungrammatical.
	Reported by Jason Molenda <jsm@cygnus.com>.

	* Bug fix (submitedit): When sending mail, use email address in
	responsible file as From, if present.
	Reported by Jason Molenda <jsm@cygnus.com>.

1999-06-25  Kenneth H. Cox  <kenstir@abraham.senteinc.com>

	* Requested enhancement:
	(sendpr): Description text area is larger (8 lines) Environment is
	smaller (2 lines).

	* Bug fixes:
	(display_query_results): Carl Lindberg fixed a bug in the results
	display when using apache + mod_perl.
	(validate_email_field):  Carl Lindberg made a change to allow
	non-qualified email addresses.

	* Speed enhancement:
	Removed 'use POSIX' since it's not needed.

1999-06-13  Kenneth H. Cox  <kenstir@abraham.senteinc.com>

	* New feature:
	The "send email to interested parties" link now includes in the
	body of the message the URL which you can use to view the PR in
	question.

	* Bug fix:
	The "send email to interested parties" link is now properly URL
	encoded.

1999-05-30  Kenneth H. Cox  <kenstir@abraham.senteinc.com>

	* Bug fix:
	X-gnatsweb-version header was being thrown away by GNATS.  Changed
	to `X-Send-Pr-Version: gnatsweb-$VERSION' so that it wouldn't be.
	Reported by rickm.

1999-05-13  Kenneth H. Cox  <kenstir@abraham.senteinc.com>

	* Bug fix:
	Replaced font() with $q->font() for old CGI.pm's.

==========  gnatsweb 2.3 released ======================================

1999-05-08  Ken Cox  <kenstir@special-sauce.senteinc.com>

	* Requested enhancement: Reporter's email address is now shown on
	the view and edit pages.

	* Bug fixes:
	(initialize): Fixed bug reported by Thomas A Peterson
	<tap@htc.honeywell.com>:  If a user has logged in, then somebody
	changes their gnatsd password, then gnatsweb got stuck; it would
	try the old password without presenting the login screen.  Now for
	the 'chdb' and 'user' commands, failure takes you to the login
	screen.
	(main): Use 'warn' to report compilation errors in
	'gnats-site.pl'.  Previously these errors were not being reported
	anywhere.
	(everywhere): Use '$q->escapeHTML' instead of 'CGI::escapeHTML',
	as the latter was not working for folks with old CGI.pm's.

	* Audit-Trail feature (submitedit): Since no conclusion was
	reached on the gnats mailing list re: the redesigned Audit-Trail
	format and how to change all of the programs to support it, I
	implemented a gnatsweb-only feature.  In the site_callback you can
	set a field's AUDITINCLUDE flag; if the flag is set then changes
	in that field are recorded in the Audit-Trail.  Multitext fields
	are indented when their old/new values are printed.  By default,
	the only fields which have the AUDITINCLUDE flag set are
	Responsible and State.

1999-04-25  Ken Cox  <kenstir@special-sauce.senteinc.com>

	* Bug fixes:
	(interested_parties): Fixed notify problems reported by someone.
	Since MLPR is not working as expected, do the work in this sub.
	(trim_responsible): Fixed bug reported by Matt.  Don't lowercase
	the Responsible name address, don't confuse Responsible with email
	addresses.

	* View PR page: Display a mailto link for sending email to all
	interested parties.

	* PR Notify lists: Now editors can add themselves to the list of
	people who get notified when a PR changes state, by changing
	"X-GNATS-Notify".  This is also available when creating a new PR.

	* New PR validation: submitnewpr() now performs more error
	checking on a new PR before mailing it.

	* Bug fixes:
	test.pl: Fixed tests so that they don't fail for lines beginning
	with '.'.  RickM #22.
	(initialize): Removed 'pending' from category list.
	(submitedit): No longer gives an error if it trims old-style
	'Responsible: kenstir (Ken Cox)' to 'Responsible: kenstir'.
	(praddr): Patch from Carl to support blank responsible field.

	* Better test harness: Does query, then uses those PR's for
	parsepr/unparsepr test.

	* In email notifications, include database name in URL.

==========  gnatsweb 2.2 released ======================================

1999-04-17  Kenneth H. Cox  <kenstir@abraham.senteinc.com>

	* site_callback: New reason 'initialize', lets the site_callback
	muck with the global data structures if desired.
	Suggested by Carl_Lindberg@BLaCKSMITH.com.

	* Advanced Query page:
	- Added reset button.  RickM #8.
	- Sort category, submitter_id, responsible lists.  RickM #5.
	- Reordered date queries on Advanced Query page, as requested by
	RickM #6.
	- Added GNATS_RELEASE_BASED date queries.

	* Create PR page: Submitter-Id and Originator are now visible;
	Submitter-Id is treated as an enumerated field.  Both are
	remembered via the cookie.

	* Misc fixes:
	- New PR no longer escapes leading '.' characters.  RickM #23.
	- No more blank cells in query results table.
	- Check 2 common places for sendmail, before bombing
	out with a helpful message.  Fixes reports of gnatsweb install
	trouble on solaris.
	- Can now display and sort by Confidential, Release, Submitter-Id.
	RickM bug #3, #10.

	* Use scrolling_list instead of checkbox_group on query page.  Was
	beginning to have too many unaligned checkboxes.

	* New $site_release_based var controls display of fields added by
	compiling gnats with -DGNATS_RELEASE_BASED
	Incorporates spirit of patches by Paul Traina <pst@juniper.net>.

1999-04-14  Kenneth H. Cox  <kenstir@abraham.senteinc.com>

	* gnatsweb.pl: Replaced CGI function calls with method
	invocations, e.g. Tr() with $q->Tr().  This is more in keeping
	with mg's style, and clears up problems which Martin Apel
	<apel@tecmath.de> had using perl 5.004_04.

1999-04-13  Kenneth H. Cox  <kenstir@abraham.senteinc.com>

	* gnatsweb.pl (view): Only print 'edit' button on View page if
	user can edit.  RickM bug #1.

1999-04-12  Kenneth H. Cox  <kenstir@abraham.senteinc.com>

	* gnatsweb.pl (submitedit): Don't complain if you can't get the
	email address of the old Responsible; it may have been invalid, or
	they may have left the company.
	Reported by Carl_Lindberg@BLaCKSMITH.com.
	(edit): When editing a PR, trim Responsible field as if it were an
	email address  Carl reports that his PR's from gnats 3.2 look this
	way.
	(sendpr, edit): Shift 'all' off of @responsible and @state.
	Reported by Carl.

==========  gnatsweb 2.1 released ======================================

* Fixed Advanced Query page: multi-selection listboxes weren't working;
was querying for "|kenstir".  Patch suggested by
Carl_Lindberg@BLaCKSMITH.com.

* site_callback() extended.  Now called for additional reasons:
        page_footer --   can print extra stuff near the bottom of the
                         page, e.g. to add buttons on the view page
        page_end_html -- can extend the absolute end of the page
Requested by Carl_Lindberg@BLaCKSMITH.com.

* --- INCOMPATIBILE CHANGES to site_callback() ---
  - When the $reason is 'page_heading', the argument list is different.
    See gnatsweb-site-sente.pl for example.  Changed for consistency.
  - No need for reason 'view_postlude'; can be done with 'page_footer'.

Changes in 2.0:

* Stored queries.

* Query results can be sorted by clicking on a column heading.

* Advanced query page for access to full power of gnats.

* Integrated with Matt Gerassimoff's "gnats.pl" for gnatsd hipness.
