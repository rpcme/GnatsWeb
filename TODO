Things that would be nice to do...

ser     Pressing Back should never resubmit an edit.
        Should tell browser not to cache that page.
        Would demand a rewrite of the Edit page, explicitly saving the
        form values, and then putting them back when people go back
        to the Edit page when they have to correct errors that result
        in a rejected submit.

ser     Implement fixed reports ala wwwgnats/CERN wwwgnats

non     o  The notify list in the Create form is too restrictive. It
        only allows
        simple addresses "aaa@bbb.ccc" separated with commas and no spaces.

        I think it should allow the following:

        Rick Macdonald <rickm@vsl.com>, "Kenneth H. Cox"
        <kenstir@senteinc.com>

non     Automatically fix shebang #! line using Makefile.PL and
        $(INSTALLBIN)

non     Some new PR field values should be sticky via cookie, e.g.
        Category, Release.
        Workaround easy: use Back button between sending reports.

# local variables:
# mode:auto-fill
# fill-prefix:"        "
# end:
