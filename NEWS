Current Version: 2.8.2
See the file ChangeLog for the details of all changes.

Changes from 2.8.1 to 2.8.2
* Fixed serious security hole allowing a attacker to read files and
  execute commands remotely on the gnatsweb server. See ChangeLog for
  the full monty.

Changes from 2.8.0 to 2.8.1
* Redirect after submitting edits wasn't working on systems with a
  new CGI.pm. This has been fixed.
* We now let people search for PRs with category 'pending'.
* We no longer by default require JavaScript for the main menu to
  work.
* The INSTALL file now makes it abundantly clear that you need a
  gnats-db.conf file even if you have only a single database.


Changes from 2.7 beta to 2.8.0
* Both the Gnats and Gnatsweb version numbers are now displayed in the
  main page footer.
* If a user pressed the 'Stop' button of the browser right after
  pressing 'Submit' on the Edit PR page, the PR would not be properly
  unlocked. This has been fixed in a hopefully watertight way.
* If edits were submitted to a locked PR, Gnatsweb would not catch the
  error, and instead display a confusing error message saying that the
  PR had been modified since you started editing it. Gnatsweb now
  properly warns of a locked PR and stops the submission.
* Documentation updates to avert problems when people install Gnatsweb
  on top of a multiple-database Gnats.
* The page banner is now a little smaller, and the text "gnatsweb" is
  now displayed in a smaller typeface.
* On the Advanced Query Page, we now display a line below 'Closed
  After' and 'Closed Before' reminding users to uncheck 'Ignore
  Closed'.
* A bug where users would be able to create new PRs with PR numbers
  composed both out of letters and numbers has been corrected.
* When a non-existing PR number was typed into the 'view' or 'edit'
  textboxes on the front page, no error message would be given, and
  the user would be presented with a blank PR. Checks have been added
  to prevent this.
* Internet Explorer users are now being properly redirected to the
  Gnatsweb main page after submitting an edit.
* Internet Explorer would try to give downloaded attachments the same
  name as the gnatsweb script file itself. This has been fixed.
* Editing PRs with attachments caused Gnatsweb 2.7 beta to crash. This
  has been fixed.
* URLs in PR text are now being automatically converted to clickable
  links when PRs are displayed.
* Fixed a bug where HTML tags in PR fields weren't being properly
  escaped before being displayed in the query results.
* It is now possible to link an external stylesheet to all Gnatsweb
  pages. The Gnatsweb-generated HTML has been thoroughly cleaned up in
  order to support stylesheets better.
