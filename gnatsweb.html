	 <H1>Gnatsweb User Guide</H1>
	 <H2>Introduction</H2>
	 <P>The <I>Gnatsweb</I> interface is a front-end to the <I>Gnats</I> problem
		tracking system used to create, view and modify Gnats problem reports. Support
		organizations can use it for tracking of issues related to products that are
		supported (i.e. software, hardware, documentation, etc.) Problem reports are
		used to notify <I>responsible</I> parties of problems. When the problems are
		looked into, the problem reports can be edited and email gets sent to all
		interested parties.</P>
	 <P> The Gnatsweb help is divided into the following sections:</P>
	 <UL>
		<LI><A HREF="#login">Login Page</A></LI>
		<LI><A HREF="#main">Main Page</A></LI>
		<LI><A HREF="#create">Create Problem Report Page</A></LI>
		<LI><A HREF="#edit">Edit Problem Report Page</A></LI>
		<LI><A HREF="#view">View Problem Report Page</A></LI>
		<LI><A HREF="#query">Query Problem Reports Page</A></LI>
		<LI><A HREF="#advquery">Advanced Query Page</A></LI>
		<LI><A HREF="#qmatches">Query Results Page</A></LI>
	 </UL>
	 <P> For more information about Gnats, see the
		<A HREF="http://sources.redhat.com/gnats/">Gnats home page</A>. </P><HR>
	 <H2><A NAME="login">Login Page</A></H2>
	 <P>The login page is used to login to the Gnats system. The first time
		Gnatsweb is used, this page is presented. After the first time, the
		<A HREF="#main">main page</A> is displayed because the settings are stored in
		cookies on the machine that has the web browser running. There is a button on
		the <A HREF="#main">main page</A> that takes the user to the Login Page. This
		button is used to select a new database if desired. There are several controls
		on the screen: </P>
	 <BLOCKQUOTE>
		<DL>
		  <DT><B>User Name:</B> (textbox) </DT>
		  <DD>This is the Gnats user name to login as. </DD>
		  <DT><B>Password:</B> (textbox)</DT>
		  <DD>This is the Gnats password for the user name.</DD>
		  <DT><B>Database:</B> (combobox)</DT>

		</DL></BLOCKQUOTE>
	 <P>If the user name and password are correct, the <A HREF="#main">main
		page</A> will be shown.</P><HR>
	 <H2><A NAME="main">Main Page</A></H2>
	 <P>The main page is used to select the various operations within the Gnats
		database. There are seven operations available from this page:</P>
	 <BLOCKQUOTE>

		</DL></BLOCKQUOTE> <HR>
	 <H2><A NAME="create">Create Problem Report Page</A></H2>
	 <P>The Create Problem Report page is used to create a new problem report.
		There are many controls on this page. Here is a description of each one: </P>
	 <BLOCKQUOTE>
		<DL>
		  <DT><B>Reporter's email:</B> (textbox)</DT>
		  <DD>This is the person filing the new problem report. This is necessary
			 because someone without access to the Gnats database may be the
			 <I>Originator</I> (described below).</DD>
		  <DT><B>CC:</B> (textbox)</DT>
		  <DD>Carbon copy the problem report to this email address. This is
			 useful for sending a new problem report to interested parties. Future changes
			 to the problem report are not emailed to this address.</DD>
		  <DT><B>Others to notify of updates:</B> (textbox)</DT>
		  <DD>This can be a comma separated list of email addresses that will be
			 notified when this problem report changes. This is useful for others that may
			 be interested in this problem.</DD>
		  <DT><B>Category:</B> (combobox)</DT>
		  <DD>This combobox allows the selection of a category which the problem
			 report should be filed under. Category names might for instance correspond to
			 product names.</DD>
		  <DT><B>Synopsis:</B> (textbox)</DT>
		  <DD>This is a short description of a problem. This is used in the
			 <A HREF="#query">Query Page</A> and the <A HREF="#advquery">Advanced Query
			 Page</A>.</DD>
		  <DT><B>Confidential:</B> (combobox)</DT>
		  <DD>This combobox selects whether or not the problem report is
			 confidential. This is useful since in-house problem reports don't necessarily
			 need to be seen by the public.</DD>
		  <DT><B>Severity:</B> (combobox)</DT>
		  <DD>This has three options: <I>critical</I>, <I>serious</I>,
			 <I>non-critical</I>. This is a best guess (i.e. if the hardware catches fire,
			 it should probably be <I>critical</I>). When creating a problem report, the
			 severity level is often merely an educated guess. It will often be changed
			 later on, based on the assessment of the Gnats administrator or the person
			 responsible for the problem category.</DD>
		  <DT><B>Priority:</B> (combobox)</DT>
		  <DD>Like severity, this is merely a guess at the priority level of the
			 problem.</DD>
		  <DT><B>Class:</B> (combobox)</DT>
		  <DD>The class of the problem. This is also a guess.</DD>
		  <DT><B>Submitter-Id:</B> (combobox)</DT>
		  <DD>The valid submitter identification. If this is unknown, leave the
			 default setting. Otherwise select the one desired.</DD>
		  <DT><B>Originator:</B> (textbox)</DT>
		  <DD>An email address of the person reporting the problem. This is often
			 the same as the <I>Reporter's email</I> address. </DD>
		  <DT><B>Release:</B> (textbox)</DT>
		  <DD>This should include the installed version of the product which the
			 problem report applies to, together with identification of applied patches,
			 updates, fixes etc. Accurate information in this field is often critical for
			 tracking and diagnosis of the problem.</DD>
		  <DT><B>Environment:</B> (textbox)</DT>
		  <DD>A description of the environment where the problem occurred.
			 Important information might include hardware make and model, operating system
			 name and version, system patchlevels etc. In general: the more, the
			 better.</DD>
		  <DT><B>Description:</B> (multi-line textbox)</DT>
		  <DD>A full description of the problem. Good descriptions become good
			 solutions. Bad descriptions make problems hard to solve.</DD>
		  <DT><B>How-To-Repeat:</B> (multi-line textbox)</DT>
		  <DD>This is a description of the steps necessary to recreate the
			 problem.</DD>
		  <DT><B>Fix:</B> (multi-line textbox)</DT>
		  <DD>If a workaround or fix has been determined, this is the place to
			 put that information.</DD>
		  <DT><B>Submit</B> (button)</DT>
		  <DD>This submits the problem report to the Gnats database. Email will
			 be sent to the <I>Reporter's email</I> and <I>Originator's</I> email addresses,
			 and all other parties listed in the <I>Others to notify</I> field. The Gnats
			 administrator and the <I>responsible</I> person also gets a copy.</DD>
		  <DT><B>Reset</B> (button)</DT>
		  <DD>Reset all fields to defaults. Most the textboxes are cleared and
			 the comboboxes are set to their defaults.</DD>
		</DL></BLOCKQUOTE> <HR>
	 <H2><A NAME="edit">Edit Problem Report Page</A></H2>
	 <P>The Edit page is used to modify a problem report when a solution or fix
		has been found, or when any other change to the problem report is required.
		Many of the fields parallel the <A HREF="#create">Create Problem Report
		Page</A> (consult that section for a description of the other fields), but
		others are specific to the edit page.</P>
	 <P> Some fields have a textbox labeled <I>Reason Changed</I> just below
		them. If the field above has been modified, the Reason Changed field must be
		filled in. This is used for tracking the changes to various fields deemed
		important enough to require an explicit reason for change.</P>
	 <P> Here are the fields on the edit page that come in addition to those on
		the Create Problem Report page:</P>
	 <BLOCKQUOTE>
		<DL>
		  <DT><B>Responsible:</B> (combobox)</DT>
		  <DD>This is the identity of the individual who is responsible for
			 handling the problem report.</DD>
		  <DT><B>Reason Changed:</B> (multi-line textbox) below the Responsible
			 field.</DT>
		  <DD>If the Responsible field changes, this must be filled in with a
			 reason for the change.</DD>
		  <DT><B>State:</B> (combobox)</DT>
		  <DD>The current state of the problem report. Usually this field is
			 changed by the Responsible person as the handling of the problem report
			 progresses.</DD>
		  <DT><B>Reason Changed:</B> (multi-line textbox) below the State
			 field.</DT>
		  <DD>If the State field changes, this must be filled in with a reason
			 for the change.</DD>
		  <DT><B>Class:</B> (combobox)</DT>
		  <DD>The class of the problem report.</DD>
		  <DT><B>Release-Note:</B> (multi-line textbox)</DT>
		  <DD>This field is usually used when a problem report has been closed
			 and incorporated into a new release of a product. The release notes are then
			 usually collected for use in an update report to be distributed with the
			 released software.</DD>
		  <DT><B>Submit Edit</B> (button)</DT>
		  <DD>This submits the changes to the Gnats database. Another page is
			 displayed with the results. If fields are missing or incorrectly filled out,
			 the changes necessary to fix the problem are displayed. By using the 'back'
			 button in the web browser, the user can go back to the problem report, correct
			 the errors and resubmit.</DD>
		  <DT><B>Audit-Trail:</B> (multi-line text display)</DT>
		  <DD>This is a cumulative description of all the changes made to this
			 problem report.</DD>
		</DL></BLOCKQUOTE> <HR>
	 <H2><A NAME="view">View Problem Report Page</A></H2>
	 <P>The View page is used to display a Gnats problem report without changing
		it. It has the same fields described in the <A HREF="#create">Create Problem
		Report Page</A> and the <A HREF="#edit">Edit Problem Report Page</A>, together
		with two additional buttons and a link:</P>
	 <BLOCKQUOTE>
		<DL>
		  <DT><B>Edit</B> (button)</DT>
		  <DD>This displays the edit page.</DD>
		  <DT><B>View audit-trail</B> (button)</DT>
		  <DD>Because the Audit-Trail field can get quite long, it is only
			 displayed when this button is clicked.</DD>
		  <DT><B>send email to interested parties</B> (link)</DT>
		  <DD>This is for sending email to the parties interested in this problem
			 report.</DD>
		</DL></BLOCKQUOTE> <HR>
	 <H2><A NAME="query">Query Problem Reports Page</A></H2>
	 <P>The Query Problem Reports page is for simple searches of the problem
		report database. It displays the <A HREF="#qmatches">Query Results Page</A>.
		The fields are "anded" together for the search, meaning that all the criteria
		selected must match each problem report searched in order for the report to be
		included in the results. There are several selections that can be made:</P>
	 <BLOCKQUOTE>
		<DL>
		  <DT><B>Submit stored query</B> (button and combobox)</DT>
		  <DD>Often repeated queries can be stored from the <A
			 HREF="#qmatches">Query Results Page</A>. This selects a previously stored
			 query. If no queries have been stored, this field is not displayed.</DD>
		  <DT><B>Category:</B> (combobox)</DT>
		  <DD>This will select <I>all</I> or a specific category to search.</DD>
		  <DT><B>Severity:</B> (combobox)</DT>
		  <DD>This will select <I>all</I> or a specific severity to search.</DD>
		  <DT><B>Priority:</B> (combobox)</DT>
		  <DD>This will select <I>all</I> or a specific priority to search.</DD>
		  <DT><B>Responsible:</B> (combobox)</DT>
		  <DD>This will select <I>all</I> or a specific responsible to
			 search.</DD>
		  <DT><B>State:</B> (combobox)</DT>
		  <DD>This will select <I>all</I> or a specific state to search.</DD>
		  <DT><B>Ignore Closed</B> (checkbox)</DT>
		  <DD>This selects whether or not to ignore closed problem reports
			 (ignore is on by default).</DD>
		  <DT><B>Class:</B> (combobox)</DT>
		  <DD>This will select <I>all</I> or a specific class to search.</DD>
		  <DT><B>Synopsis Search:</B> (textbox)</DT>
		  <DD>This will search the synopsis field for the text entered.</DD>
		  <DT><B>Multi-line Text Search:</B>
		  </DT>
		  <DD>This will search all the multi-line text fields for the text
			 entered.</DD>
		  <DT><B>Column Display:</B> (multi-select listbox)</DT>
		  <DD>This selects the columns to be displayed in the query results
			 table. The selection is stored by the web browser, so the next time a query is
			 requested, the columns selected for the previous query will be selected by
			 default.</DD>
		  <DT><B>Submit query</B> (button)</DT>
		  <DD>This submits the query and the <A HREF="#qmatches">Query Results
			 Page</A> is displayed.</DD>
		</DL></BLOCKQUOTE>
	 <HR>
	 <H2><A NAME="advquery">Advanced Query Problem Reports Page</A></H2>
	 <P>The Advanced Query Problem Reports page is not for the faint of heart.
		This is a very complicated form with many features. There are three buttons and
		a combobox to start the search:</P>
	 <BLOCKQUOTE>
		<DL>
		  <DT><B>Submit stored query</B> (button and combobox)</DT>
		  <DD>Often repeated queries can be stored from the <A
			 HREF="#qmatches">Query Results Page</A>. This selects a previously stored
			 query. If no queries have been stored, this field is not displayed.</DD>
		  <DT><B>Submit query</B> (button)</DT>
		  <DD>Submit the advanced query, and display the <A
			 HREF="#qmatches">Query Results Page</A>.</DD>
		  <DT><B>Reset</B> (button)</DT>
		  <DD>Reset the form.</DD>
		</DL></BLOCKQUOTE>
	 <P>There are four sub-sections to this form:</P>
	 <OL TYPE="1">
		<LI>Search All Text</LI>
		<LI>Search By Date</LI>
		<LI>Search Individual Fields</LI>
		<LI>Select Columns to Display</LI>
	 </OL>
	 <P>Any one of these sub-sections can be used separately or together for
		complex searches.</P>
	 <H3>Search All Text</H3>
	 <P>There are two types of searches on all text:</P>
	 <OL TYPE="1">
		<LI>Single-line text fields</LI>
		<LI>Multi-line text fields</LI>
	 </OL>
	 <P>Regular expressions can be used in searches.</P>
	 <H3>Search By Date</H3>
	 <P>The Search By Date sub-section allows you to limit the range of problem
		reports according to various time parameters. There are six self explanatory
		fields available:</P>
	 <OL TYPE="1">
		<LI>Arrived After</LI>
		<LI>Arrived Before</LI>
		<LI>Modified After</LI>
		<LI>Modified Before</LI>
		<LI>Closed After</LI>
		<LI>Closed Before</LI>
	 </OL>
	 <P>The dates are entered in a string like: <KBD>1999-04-01 05:00 GMT</KBD>.
		Though the date matching scheme is pretty robust, it should accept quite a few
		formats.</P>
	 <H3>Search Individual Fields</H3>
	 <P>The Search Individual Fields sub-section is used for matching based on a
		specific field in the Gnats problem report. All the fields have a textbox for
		doing regular expression searches. Where applicable, fields have a multi-select
		listbox that can be used. When nothing is entered for the textbox or selected
		in the listbox, those fields are not used in the match. Here are the valid
		matchable fields:</P>
	 <UL>
		<LI>Category</LI>
		<LI>Synopsis</LI>
		<LI>Confidential</LI>
		<LI>Severity</LI>
		<LI>Priority</LI>
		<LI>Responsible</LI>
		<LI>State</LI>
		<LI>Class</LI>
		<LI>Submitter-Id</LI>
		<LI>Originator</LI>
		<LI>Release</LI>
	 </UL>
	 <P>Each field is described in the <A HREF="#create">Create Problem Report
		Page</A> or the <A HREF="#edit">Edit Problem Report Page</A> sections of this
		user guide. The 'state' field also has an 'Ignore Closed' checkbox to ignore
		all closed problem reports.</P>
	 <H3>Select Columns to Display</H3>
	 <P>This sub-section is a multi-select listbox that is used to set the
		displayable columns in the <A HREF="#qmatches">Query Results Page</A>.</P><HR>
	 <H2><A NAME="qmatches">Query Results Page</A></H2>
	 <P>The problem report table displayed shows the problem report numbers as
		links to the <A HREF="#view">View Problem Report Page</A>. In order to sort the
		table by the contents of a specific column, click the column heading.</P>
	 <P> At the bottom of the page is a text entry field and a button to store a
		query selection. Stored queries are accessible from the <A HREF="#query">Query
		Problem Reports Page</A> or the <A HREF="#advquery">Advanced Query Problem
		Reports Page</A>. This provides for a quick way to repeat often-made searches
		without having to make all the selections again. </P></BODY>
