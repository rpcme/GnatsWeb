                        Customizing Gnatsweb 4


Gnatsweb customization
======================

Gnatsweb was designed with customization in mind. It provides two
primary mechanisms for this:

- Configuration variables
- Callback hooks in the code

Both methods involve editing the gnatsweb-site.pl file which was
installed together with the main gnatsweb.pl script.  Indeed, all
changes or additions you make to Gnatsweb should be put into this
file, since that will make maintenance and upgrading to future
versions of Gnatsweb much easier.

The use of Gnatsweb configuration variables is described in the file
CUSTOMIZE.vars, and callback hooks are documented in CUSTOMIZE.cb.
